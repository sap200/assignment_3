# Token Swap Smart Contract

## Problem Description

Create a smart contract that facilitates the swapping of one ERC-20 token for another at a predefined exchange rate. The smart contract should include the following features:

## Design Choices

## Security Considerations

## Test Cases


## Features

- Users can swap Token A for Token B and vice versa.
- The exchange rate between Token A and Token B is fixed.
- Implement proper checks to ensure that the swap adheres to the exchange rate.
- Include events to log swap details.

## Requirements

- Implement the smart contract in Solidity.
- Use the ERC-20 standard for both tokens.
- Ensure proper error handling and event logging.
- Implement the swap functionality securely and efficiently.

It's just better.
